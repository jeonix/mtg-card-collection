This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once development server is running, navigate to localhost:3000 in a browser.

## Pages

### Home
User is brought to the welcome page. It is barren at the moment. Nav bar shows the different pages currently available.

### Collection
Collection is the page where the user can view the cards that they have added to the database. In the left column, the various set names that the user's collection belong to is shown. The rest of the page contains the each individual card the user has currently in the database. Dates are shown as to when the card was added to the database and when the market value price of that card was last updated.
